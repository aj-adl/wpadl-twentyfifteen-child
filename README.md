# wpadl-twentyfifteen-child
Twentyfifteen child theme created for the example site for my wp-adl talk 

The site is self-referencing, so it will contain examples of code, tutorials on changes etc, while the site is itself a direct product of those changes. 

This repository allows you to see the actual theme code the site is running, along with being able to browse through the commits for adding and refining certain features. 

The code is quite well commented, if you have any questions about what a certain thing does then feel free to ask.
